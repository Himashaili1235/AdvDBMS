# Secure Student Grading Management System (SGS)

## Description
The **Secure Student Grading Management System (SGS)** is a web-based platform designed to securely manage student grades with a focus on **data integrity, encryption, and access control**. The system implements **role-based authentication (RBAC), SHA-256 password hashing, AES encryption, and audit logging** to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and manual errors.

## Features

### üîí Secure Authentication & Access Control
- **SHA-256 Hashing with Salt** for secure password storage.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** enhances security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - **Students:** View grades only.
  - **Professors:** Input and update grades.
  - **Admins:** Manage system operations.

### üîê Data Encryption for Protection
- **AES-256 Encryption** secures student grades from unauthorized access.
- **Data-at-Rest Encryption:** Grades stored in encrypted format.
- **Data-in-Transit Encryption (TLS/SSL):** Prevents interception during transmission.
- **Implementation:**
  ```sql
  -- Encrypting data
  AES_ENCRYPT('A', 'key')
  
  -- Decrypting data
  AES_DECRYPT(grade, 'key')
  ```

### üìä Audit Logging & Monitoring
- Tracks **all user actions** (logins, grade updates, unauthorized access attempts).
- **Real-time alerts** for suspicious activities.
- **Automated log analysis** detects unusual login patterns.
- **Periodic security audits** ensure compliance with best practices.

### üõ°Ô∏è SQL Injection Prevention
- Uses **prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Restricts **access permissions** based on roles.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install **MySQL Workbench** for database management.
2. Install **XAMPP**
3. Install **Visual Studio Code** or any preferred IDE.

### Database Configuration
1. Import the provided **SQL file** into MySQL Workbench to create the necessary tables.
2. Update database connection settings in the backend:
   ```javascript
   const mysql = require('mysql');
   const connection = mysql.createConnection({
       host: 'localhost',
       user: 'root',
       password: '',
       database: 'SGS'
   });
   ```

## Running the Application
- Start Apache and MySQL services in XAMPP.
- Place the project folder in the htdocs directory.
- Open the application in your browser at http://localhost/main.php
